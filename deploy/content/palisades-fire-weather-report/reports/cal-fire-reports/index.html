      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>Between <strong>10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on January 7 2025</strong>, the Palisades Fire expanded modestly—from <em>10 acres to 200 acres</em>—while wind speeds remained moderate. The highest sustained wind recorded nearby was <strong>35.7 mph</strong>, with gusts up to <strong>44 mph</strong>, well below thresholds that typically render wildfire suppression impossible. Assertions that the blaze was instantly uncontrollable due to extreme winds in this window are not supported by the data.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Timeline of Cal Fire Reports & Acreage Growth</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>10:30 a.m.</strong>: Initial Cal Fire estimate – <em>10 acres</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>11:06 a.m.–11:26 a.m.</strong>: Four consecutive updates – fire <em>steady at 10 acres</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>11:31 a.m.–2:31 p.m.</strong>: Fourteen reports – acreage increases to <em>200 acres</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>3:34 p.m.–10:20 p.m.</strong>: Twenty reports – fire grows to <em>1,262 acres</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>January 8, 12:29 a.m.–11:11 a.m.</strong>: Eight updates – fire reaches <em>2,921 acres</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>January 8, 11:45 a.m.</strong>: Cal Fire reports expansion to <em>11,802 acres</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wind Conditions During the Critical Six‑Hour Window</h2>
      <p>Throughout the 10 a.m.–4 p.m. period, <strong>Malibu’s peak sustained wind</strong> was <strong>35.7 mph</strong>, with gusts peaking at <strong>44 mph</strong>. Both values fall within historically typical Santa Ana events and remain far below the 50–60 mph range often associated with rapidly uncontrollable fire behavior.</p>

      <h2>Implications for Fire Management</h2>
      <p>The overlap of <em>manageable wind speeds</em> and <em>limited acreage growth</em> suggests that containment efforts during this period may have benefitted from different resource deployments or strategies. This analysis underscores the importance of accurate real‑time data interpretation when making suppression decisions.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The Palisades Fire remained comparatively small (≤ 200 acres) until after 2:30 p.m.</li>
        <li>Wind conditions stayed within historical norms, undermining claims of unprecedented, uncontrollable weather.</li>
        <li>The 10 a.m.–4 p.m. window represents a critical opportunity for containment that warrants closer review by incident commanders and policymakers.</li>
      </ol>
