      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        On January 7 2025, wind conditions near Pacific Palisades were not unprecedented. Throughout the day, the highest recorded wind speed was 40.8 mph in Malibu (7.1 miles from the fire), with gusts reaching 60 mph in Pacific Palisades at 5:15 PM. Hurricane-force winds begin at 74 mph, so the fire did not spread under record-breaking or unmanageable wind conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Detail</h2>
      <p>
        Analysis of 48 weather stations across the impacted region shows that sustained winds never exceeded 40.8 mph, and gusts peaked at 60 mph.
        Most stations recorded far lower values. This data challenges any false assertion that the fire’s rapid growth was driven by hurricane-level winds.
